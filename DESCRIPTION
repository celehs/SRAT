Package: SRAT
Version: 0.2.0
Title: Sequence Robust Association Test
Author: Ming Yang, Wei Dai, Tianxi Cai
Maintainer: Ming Yang <hustyangming@gmail.com>
Description: Implements a fully rank-based and flexible approach to test for association between a set of genetic variants and an outcome, while accounting for within-family correlation and adjusting for covariates. SRAT includes the well-known Wilcoxon rank sum test as a special case. Comparing to existing methods, SRAT has the advantages of allowing for unknown correlation structures and weaker assumptions about the outcome distribution.
